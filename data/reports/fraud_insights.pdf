# ðŸ“Š Business Insights from Data Pre-Processing
ðŸ”¹ Zero-Amount Transactions as Potential Fraud Indicators
âœ… A significantly higher fraud rate (1.38%) in zero-amount transactions compared to non-zero (0.16%) suggests fraudsters may be using them for system probingâ€”testing stolen cards before executing larger transactions.
âœ… This "test transaction" pattern is common in fraud schemes, where small or zero-value transactions are attempted to check if the card is active before making high-value fraudulent purchases.
ðŸ”¹ Risk-Based Fraud Prevention Strategy
âœ… Financial institutions & merchants should flag or block zero-value transactions from unknown sources or require additional verification.
âœ… Adaptive fraud detection models should weigh zero-amount transactions higher when assessing risk, as they have an 8.6x higher fraud likelihood.
âœ… Transaction monitoring systems should trigger real-time alerts for repeated zero-value transactions from the same card, especially if followed by large transactions.
ðŸ”¹ Policy Adjustments for Banks & Payment Processors
âœ… Restricting zero-amount transactions unless explicitly permitted by the merchant can reduce fraud risk.
âœ… Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for zero-value transactions can prevent fraudsters from successfully testing stolen cards.
ðŸ“Š Business Insights from Fraud Timing Analysis
ðŸ”¹ Fraud Peaks at 2nd & 11th Transaction Hour
âœ… Fraud spikes during these hours suggest attackers may be strategically timing their transactions.
âœ… Possible explanations:
â€¢	Exploiting system weaknesses during times when fraud monitoring is less active.
â€¢	High transaction volume periods, allowing fraud to blend in unnoticed.
âœ… Business Actionable Insights:
â€¢	Banks & payment processors should increase fraud monitoring and flag transactions during these peak fraud hours.
â€¢	AI-based fraud detection models should assign a higher risk score to transactions made during these peak fraud periods.
ðŸ”¹ Low Fraud at 0th & 10th Hour
âœ… Fewer fraud attempts during these hours could mean:
â€¢	Fraudsters avoid midnight transactions (0th hour) when banking activity is minimal, making fraudulent activity more noticeable.
â€¢	The 10th hour could be a time when fraud detection systems are more effective.
âœ… Business Recommendations:
â€¢	Banks should analyze fraud detection system logs during these hours to determine if their monitoring is more effective or if fraudsters avoid these times for other reasons.
â€¢	Introduce randomized fraud detection intensity throughout the day to prevent attackers from exploiting predictable monitoring weaknesses.
ðŸ”¹ Limitations: Weekday Analysis Not Useful
âœ… Since the dataset only covers two days, fraud by weekday analysis doesnâ€™t provide broader trends.
âœ… Future Improvement:
â€¢	Analyzing transactions over a longer timeframe (weeks/months) could reveal weekend vs. weekday fraud patterns.
â€¢	Incorporating external factors like banking hours, holiday effects, or payday spikes may enhance fraud detection strategies.

ðŸ“Š Business Insights from Fraud vs. Transaction Amount Analysis
ðŸ”¹ Fraud is Highest in Small Transactions (Â£) â†’ 267 frauds
âœ… Fraudsters prefer small transactions, likely to avoid detection and bypass fraud monitoring systems.
âœ… These transactions may be small enough not to trigger alerts, making them an ideal way for fraudsters to test stolen cards or exploit weaknesses.
âœ… Business Actionable Insights:
â€¢	Implement dynamic fraud thresholds where multiple small transactions from the same account within a short time trigger alerts.
â€¢	Use AI-driven anomaly detection to spot suspicious patterns of frequent low-value transactions.
ðŸ”¹ Zero-Amount Transactions (Â£0) â†’ 25 frauds
âœ… Zero-value frauds could indicate test transactions, where fraudsters check if a card is valid before making larger purchases.
âœ… Possible Explanations:
â€¢	Fraudsters may be exploiting a loophole in transaction processing.
â€¢	Some merchants or banks may allow Â£0 pre-authorization transactions as part of their system.
âœ… Business Recommendations:
â€¢	Monitor and flag Â£0 transactionsâ€”many payment systems donâ€™t expect Â£0 values, making them a potential fraud signal.
â€¢	If Â£0 transactions serve a legitimate purpose, ensure they are logged and analyzed for unusual activity.
ðŸ”¹ Moderate to High Fraud in Medium Transactions (Â£Â£) â†’ 99 frauds
âœ… While not as frequent as small transactions, fraud still exists in mid-sized payments.
âœ… Business Recommendations:
â€¢	Implement real-time verification for medium transactions, especially for new or high-risk accounts.
ðŸ”¹ Fraud is Least in Very Large Transactions (Â£Â£Â£Â£) â†’ 9 frauds
âœ… Large transactions typically require additional verification, reducing fraud attempts.
âœ… Takeaway: Fraudsters avoid high-value transactions due to stricter security protocols.
âœ… Business Optimization Tip:
â€¢	Maintain multi-factor authentication for large transactions but streamline the process for legitimate users to reduce friction.

ðŸ’° Business Insights from Average Transaction Amount (Fraud vs. Non-Fraud)
ðŸ”¹ Fraudulent Transactions Have a Higher Average Amount
âœ… The average fraud transaction amount is Â£123.8, whereas the average non-fraud transaction amount is Â£88.41.
âœ… This suggests that fraudsters strategically target higher-value transactions to maximize financial gain.
ðŸ”¹ Key Takeaways for Fraud Prevention
âœ… Fraud detection systems should assign higher risk scores to high-value transactions, especially when combined with other suspicious factors (e.g., multiple small transactions leading up to a big one).
âœ… Real-time transaction monitoring should flag high-value purchases from new or unusual locations.
âœ… Banks and merchants should implement stepped verification (e.g., OTP, biometric authentication) for high-value transactions to deter fraud attempts.
