# Fraud Detection Analysis using Power BI

## 📌 Overview
This project analyzes fraud detection in financial transactions using Power BI. The dataset is preprocessed, visualized, and analyzed to extract business insights and identify fraudulent activities effectively.

## 📊 Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, creating new features, and cleaning the dataset.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Detecting fraud patterns through visualizations.
- **Fraud Trend Analysis**: Identifying fraud hotspots using time-series and categorical analysis.
- **Business Insights**: Extracting actionable insights to improve fraud detection.

## 📉 Insights from Analysis
### 🔍 Fraudulent Transaction Patterns
- Fraud is **8.6x more frequent** in zero-amount transactions, indicating potential system testing by fraudsters.
- Fraud occurs **most frequently** during the **2nd and 11th hour** of transactions.
- **Smaller transactions** have the highest fraud cases, suggesting fraudsters avoid detection.

### 🔹 Business Recommendations
✅ Implement stricter verification for **zero-amount** and **small transactions**.<br>
✅ Increase fraud monitoring during **2nd and 11th hours**.<br>
✅ Enhance anomaly detection algorithms to catch emerging fraud trends.<br>
